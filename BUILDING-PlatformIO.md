# Building firmware using PlatformIO

**NOTE: this is a work in progress; documentation is provided for anyone interested in investigating this toolchain. Proceed at your own risk!**

### Requirements:

* A supported LZX Eurorack module (either Diver or Escher Sketch)
* Visual Studio Code or another IDE supported by PlatformIO
* Windows, Linux, or macOS
* A USB-A to Mini-B cable, or a STLink compatible programmer

## Install Prerequisites

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Run Visual Studio Code and [follow these instructions](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) to install the PlatformIO extension.
   * If you'd like to use a different IDE, read the [PlatformIO integration instructions here](https://platformio.org/install/integration). The rest of this document will assume Visual Studio Code, but the process should be similar in any IDE that PlatformIO integrates with.
3. Clone the forked repository at `https://github.com/Dewb/lzxsoftware` to your local computer using one of these methods:
   * Open Visual Studio Code and and choose "Clone Git repository" on the start screen and enter the above URL.
   * (Advanced) Use the [Git command-line tools](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
4. If it's not already selected, switch to the `dewb/platformio` branch using the Visual Studio source control toolbar, or the `git switch` command.

## Build the firmware and upload it to the hardware with USB

***IMPORTANT NOTE**: Do not connect your module to a computer with USB at the same time it is connected to Eurorack power.*

*Misconfiguring electronics could damage your module, your Eurorack case, and/or your computer. Proceed completely at your own risk!*

1. Disconnect your module from Eurorack power, and connect a USB A to Mini-B cable between your computer and the USB port on the back of the module.
2. Diver should present as a USB device in Device Firmware Update mode. If it doesn't appear in your USB device tree, or you get DFU errors in later steps, you may need to install the [STM32 programming tools](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) to make sure your device is recognized. Restart Visual Studio Code after your've installed the STM32 tools.
3. Choose *Terminal > Run Task...* and select *PlatformIO: Upload (diver-usb)*, or click the arrow icon in the lower left PlatformIO toolbar. 
4. Disconnect the USB cable and reconnect the module to Eurorack power.

## Uploading firmware and debugging with ST-Link

***IMPORTANT NOTE**: Misconfiguring electronics could damage your module, your Eurorack case, and/or your computer. Proceed completely at your own risk!*

Debugging with PlatformIO should work with one or more of the following devices: 

* [STLink V2 clone](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2548)
   | Diver pin | STLink v2 pin |
   | ----------|---------------|
   | 6 +3V3    | 8 3.3V        |
   | 5 NRST    |               |
   | 4 SWO     |               |
   | 3 SWCLK   | 3 SWCLK       |
   | 2 SWDIO   | 4 SWDIO       |
   | 1 GND     | 5 GND         |

* [Official STLink V2 or V2-ISOL](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html)
   | Diver pin | STLink v2 pin |
   | ----------|---------------|
   | 6 +3V3    | 1 MCU VDD     |
   | 5 NRST    |               |
   | 4 SWO     |               |
   | 3 SWCLK   | 9 SWCLK       |
   | 2 SWDIO   | 7 SWDIO       |
   | 1 GND     | 12 GND        |

1. Disconnect your module from Eurorack power and disconnect the ST-Link from USB.
2. Connect the specified pins of the debugger to the 6-pin debugging connector on the back panel of the module. Pin 1 is the closest to the bottom edge of the board.
3. Reconnect Eurorack power and turn on your case. Connect the ST-Link to your computer with a USB cable.
4. Choose *Terminal > Run Task...* and select *PlatformIO: Upload (diver-stlink)*, or click the *Switch PlatformIO Project Environment* control on the PlatformIO toolbar and select *env:diver-stlink*, then click the arrow icon in the lower left of the toolbar. 
5. To debug the firmware code, go to *Run > Start Debugging* or hit F5. The module will reboot and pause in the initialization routine.

## Other debugging options that should work

* [Official STLink V3](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stlink-v3set.html) or [V3-MINIE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stlink-v3minie.html)
   * TBD

* [Segger J-Link](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/)
   * TBD
